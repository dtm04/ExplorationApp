# About
This project was part of a Wentowrth class called "International Epic".  I worked with 3 students from
SUSTech in Shenzhen, China.  We coordinated over skype for a few weeks, then worked in person for a couple weeks
in Boston.  My teammates from Shenzhen helped with this software and by creating an Arduino and drone add-on.

### Lessons Learned
-  Kotlin
-  Google Maps API
-  A little bit of Firebase
-  Geofencing
-  Map TileOverlay
-  Android Room
-  MVVM Architecture
-  Arduino

### Future To-Do's
Hopefully I'll some more time to keep working on this project here and there.
I am really enjoying Kotlin, I have a Pixel 3 phone, so I'll probably use
this as my playground for a little while. 

Here are some future ideas to implement:
 *  fab button on map link to save location + add photo option
 *  Use geofence to update TileOverlay
 *  Misty/Foggy map overlay, or differentiate grid squares.
 *  Connect bluetooth receiver to Arduino
 *  Configure Arduino drone to use GPS and/or camera
 *  Upload arduino statstics to application
 *  (Optional) Convert, or add, cloud based storage
 *  (Optional) User Authentication and accounts
 *  (Optional) Integrate with google places API find nearby areas
 *  Use some more fun Google cloud stuff.
